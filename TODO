---+ Deal with comments and different formatting

One of the options is to process the clause with the term-positions and comments
to `annotate' terms. Here are some examples

	'$annot'(List, string).		% "hello"
	'$annot'(Code, char_code).	% 0'x
	'$annot'(Code, hex).		% 0x12
	'$annot'(Code, base(6)).	% 6'12
	'$annot'(Token, comment(Comment, Indent))
